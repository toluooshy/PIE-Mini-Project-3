# PIE-Mini-Project-3
The following report aims to depict the mechanical, electrical, computational, and collaborative work done to build and program reflectance IR sensor guided, DC motor controlled robot. The purpose in completing this project was to integrate our abilities to sense the physical world through sensors connected to microcontrollers with our abilities to act on the physical world through actuators.   

### Abstract:   

The goal of mini-project 3 was to make our own line-following wheeled robot. We created a two sensor scanner with IR sensors in order to distinguish the floor and a black piece of electrical tape. The wheeled robot makes slight adjustments left and right according to the readings that either of the two scanners produces.
